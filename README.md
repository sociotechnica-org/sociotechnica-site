# Sociotechnica.org Site

This is the main website for [sociotechnica.org](https://sociotechnica.org), a joint project of [Jess Martin and Danvers Fleury](https://sociotechnica.org/about), trying to solve the problem of how to reliably resource open source software.

## Developing

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deployment

The site is deployed automatically to Netlify when changes are merged into the `main` branch.
