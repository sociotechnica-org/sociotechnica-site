Hello There,

We've had a busy 8 weeks.

Jess began fleshing out our AI-native digital work environment concept, [Work Squared](https://worksquared.ai/), by laying out the [technical foundations](https://sociotechnica.org/notebook/ws-tech-foundations/).

We then spun up our [Lab Notes](https://sociotechnica.org/notebook/forward/) to work this bad boy out loud!

This began with a [user interface time travel safari](https://sociotechnica.org/notebook/ws-ui-safari/) back to the 1980s & 1990s to find some first principles inspirations for how to craft the environment.

Then an intense daylong sprint transforming those inspirations into [workable artifacts to innovate with](https://sociotechnica.org/notebook/planning-a-collab/).

Our innovation session combined with a well timed re-reading of [an Alan Kay classic](https://worrydream.com/refs/Kay_1989_-_User_Interface,_a_Personal_View.pdf) sparked a new, yet actually quite old [workflow and learning management breakthrough](https://sociotechnica.org/notebook/symbolic/) inspired by one of Danvers' favorite childhood toys.

And we wrapped up with Jess shipping out to Berlin to [Local-First Conf](https://www.localfirstconf.com/) to share some thoughts on a topic near and dear to our little invention: data interoperability as [The Last Mile of Local-First Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCT4J4g2Ung).

Are you doing, or trying, to do anything cool vis a vis human+AI collaboration at work? Drop us a line, we're entering into "test and learn like crazy" mode.

Thanks as always for coming along on our odyssey - we remain optimistic on the future of human+computer collaboration!

-Jess & Danvers
