Hello There,

For those in the world of AI, the Summer of '25 will be remembered as one of extreme disruption, with the model arms race heating up, and AI capabilities exploding.

SocioTechnica's mission remains the same: to improve human + computer collaboration. The summer has involved a more focused *how:* making [Work Squared](https://worksquared.ai/) the best place to build and manage human + AI teams. To get maximum velocity we're first **using Work Squared to square our own personal capacity.**

CEOs have executive assistants. The ultra-rich have house managers. What would it look like if we had an AI army of administrative help, super-powering our lives? How do you even do that?

Enter our favorite guinea pig, Danvers, with the executive function of a moldy muffin. He dug deep into his disorganized life as his own first-time admin:  
[WS005: Can AI Cure My Addiction to Overcommitting?](https://sociotechnica.org/notebook/overcommitting/)  
[WS006: Working My Life Into Burnout](https://sociotechnica.org/notebook/life-burnout/)

In the meantime, Jess has been pushing Work Squared to become the [Jarvis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg_nD_x0bgM) to our hapless heroes' Iron Man (men?).

In order for Work Squared to be useful for us, the underlying platform has to be solid. The last few months have marked progress building core capabilities on top of [LiveStore](https://livestored.dev/), a new event-source syncing framework. Here is a [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXHzy92LWyU) of how we're using it, if you're the curious and deeply-technical type.

June was our breakthrough month. After months of rather frustrating experimentation, Jess figured out how to [delegate multiple software engineering tasks to LLMs](https://youtu.be/MPbRGZtIHu4) and get reasonable quality work done. The speed of progress since then has been *sickeningly* fast.

So what's the next stop on The Road to Jarvis? MCP powering Work Squared and integrating our prototyped 'agent builder'.

Sound interesting?

1. If you want to follow along with all of the work we're doing on Work Squared, it's as simple as [starring the GitHub repo](https://github.com/sociotechnica-org/work-squared/). You read that right. Work Squared is now source-available under the `FSL-1.1-ALv2` license.
2. Would you like to try out your own Jarvis? Drop us a line and we'll get you alpha access in the coming weeks.

-Jess & Danvers
