In the early spring of 2025, my business partner Jess and I found ourselves deeply dug into solving other people's problems - client problems - after having run into a brick wall trying to get AI agents to independently operate in a marketplace on our behalf.

To be sure, the technology wasn't quite thereâ€¦.but a lot goes unsaid in such a statement. The devil is in the details. Why? Why, when we integrated agents into our workflow and attempted to give them a guided but independent role were things going so horribly wrong?

We'd bitched about it together. We'd sketched around a little. And then we'd put our heads back down to go solve other problems. This isn't atypical of how we've worked together over the years; it usually comes in fits and starts.

Jess isn't just a guy that I invent with - he's one of my dearest friends. We've known each other for a long time - long enough to have had a few quarrels, fundamental disagreements, and frustrations with one another. This has helped shape our [most excellent agreement](/agrmt) for working together, and it's understood that we may go 6 months without needing to reference it because we're, for the most part, working on different things.

It is with this backdrop that, separated by workflows and geographies, I received an intellectual and emotional cherry bomb conveniently disguised as a lab note - [Jess' technical whitepaper outline positing the causes and effects of modern LLM's architecture problem](https://notes.jessmart.in/My+Writings/WorkSquared+Technical+Whitepaper).

Reading it, I felt a surprising emotion: **jealousy.** This little scribble felt like a window into the _near_ future. It was a technological roadmap that could unlock some of the greatest sociotechnological barriers to human+computer collaboration. It took our learnings, went backwards, wiped the slate clean, and began a new, extremely hopeful chapter.

That was _my_ reading experience. I wouldn't expect it to be _yours_. As Jess often says, our lab notes can read like the scribbles of madmen. But to me, this felt like truth. I called him up and told him exactly what was in my heart, "Dude, I'm jealous of you!" And then I felt better. Giddy really. Because Jess had shown me a bright light on a future that I felt desperate to build, right behind the brick wall with an imprint of my forehead on it. This notebook is the story of what happens next.
