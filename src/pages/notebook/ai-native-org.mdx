*It goes AI native too.*

Software production velocity is accelerating dramatically—potentially 10x–100x faster through "compile" style assembly of working software. The infrastructure enabling this is being built publicly right now by teams recognizing that AI capability wasn't the bottleneck; deployment was.

## Coming Soon: The Software Factory

Most developers currently operate in "me plus one to three AI buddies" mode. The real breakthrough occurs when 10, 20, or 50 agents work in parallel, coordinated by systems built for coordination. Agents execute work while humans review at decision gates.

The emerging SDLC isn't a process developers shepherd tasks through—it's an assembly line where tasks flow through specialized stations. Each station's optimization compounds across every future task.

## The State of Orchestration

Modern orchestrators address six core problems:

- State management (agents lack persistent memory)
- Task decomposition (complex work exceeds single sessions)
- Coordination (workload distribution)
- Monitoring (detecting stuck agents)
- Communication (context sharing between agents)
- Output integration (merging without conflicts)

Approaches diverge philosophically. Some simulate human org charts, recreating coordination friction. Others treat orchestration as an operational problem: coordinators, workers, monitors—designed for how AI actually functions: parallel, stateless, fallible.

Operational approaches appear to be winning, unless fundamental model-level changes occur. References to Claude Flow and Loom hint at near-future architectures.

## The Contagion Opportunity

Compilation represents just one of three core product functions:

- **Design** — Transform signals into specifications
- **Build** — Transform specifications into code
- **Distribute** — Transform code into signals

When Build accelerates 50x relative to Design and Distribute, organizational alignment fractures. The same orchestration patterns enabling rapid building—task decomposition, specialization, parallel execution, human gates—apply to Design and Distribute.

Design orchestration breaks signal processing into atomic tasks, runs them through specialized agents in parallel, and surfaces synthesized options for human decisions. Distribute orchestration structures deployment into atomic steps with parallel monitoring and feedback collection, surfacing anomalies for human approval.

This structural contagion means every product function accelerates simultaneously.

## The Alignment Opportunity

With 50 agents and 12 humans across Design, Build, and Distribute operating at 10x+ throughput, coordinated decision-making becomes critical—ensuring choices align with strategy, don't repeat past failures, don't break adjacent systems, and don't violate platform philosophy.

Current orchestrators manage operational state—workflow graphs, progress, blockers. They lack semantic state management—the meaning behind work: why features exist, what was attempted previously, adjacent context, strategic purpose.

A "Context Library" concept emerges as essential: a five-dimensional knowledge graph with AI curation and gap assessment, providing task-specific context assembly on demand.

Most teams possess WHAT (specifications) and HOW (code, documentation). The missing components are WHERE (ecosystem context), WHEN (evolutionary context), and WHY (objectives context)—implicit knowledge humans absorb through osmosis that agents rarely encounter.

The semantic substrate modern orchestrators lack is precisely this contextual grounding.

## Bringing It All Together

**First:** Orchestration is evolving from "how do I coordinate coding agents" to "how do I orchestrate this software factory." Winning approaches treat it as operational rather than simulating human hierarchies.

**Second:** Design and Distribute will follow Build's acceleration trajectory—contagion is inevitable.

**Third:** Operational orchestration alone is insufficient. Agents and humans need semantic context for aligned decisions. Teams externalizing institutional knowledge—making the implicit explicit, making tribal knowledge queryable—will pull ahead.

**The hot take:** We're in early innings of building AI-native software factories, positioning us roughly 36 months from the truly AI-native organization—the timeframe required to sustain maximum productivity.
