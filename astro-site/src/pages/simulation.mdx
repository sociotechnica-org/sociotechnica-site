At [Next LX](https://sociotechnica.org/projects/#next-lx), we're building a simulation-based training program that prepares candidates in an AI-powered workplace. We call it a "flight simulator for office work."

But we sometimes get asked "Why build a simulator? Seems like a lot of work."

Simulations are the best way to learn any skill.

## The Principle of Simulation-Based Training: Do Real Work
We believe simulation-based training is the most effective way to acquire *any* skill. The fundamental principle is simple: the best way to learn to do something is to actually do the real thing. For instance, if you wanted to teach someone how to hit a baseball, you wouldn't merely lecture them on the physics of baseballs or have them watch instructional videos. You would take them to a field and have them hit real baseballs. This hands-on approach is the core of simulation-based training.  

## What is Simulation-Based Training?
Simulation-based training involves performing the skill in an environment that mimics the real-world context as closely as possible. It allows learners to practice the actual skill they're trying to acquire, but in a controlled, safe environment. In fact, simulation can be even more effective than real-world practice for several reasons:

1. Structured Repetition: Simulations allow for repeated practice without real-world consequences. You can retry scenarios multiple times, refining your skills with each attempt.
2. Enhanced Assessment: Simulations can incorporate more comprehensive assessment tools than are possible in real-world settings. For example, a baseball simulation might use high-speed cameras to analyze a player's form in minute detail.
3. Optimal Sequencing: In a simulation, learning experiences can be carefully sequenced to keep learners in the "zone of proximal development" - challenging enough to promote growth, but not so difficult as to cause frustration.
4. Low-Stakes Practice of High-Risk Scenarios: Simulations allow for the safe practice of rare but critical situations that would be too risky or expensive to replicate in the real world.

## Current Job Training Methods and Their Limitations
While there are several popular methods for job training, each has significant limitations compared to simulation-based training:

1. YouTube: "But you can learn for free on the internet!" While an incredible resource, watching videos alone doesn't provide the hands-on experience necessary for skill mastery. People don't learn to bake by watching the Great British Baking Show--they learn to bake by baking.
2. Online Courses: "There's a course for everything!" These offer good sequencing and repetition but often lack real-world context and application.
3. Project-Based Learning: "Just build stuff!" While valuable, standalone projects may be disconnected from the real work environment and miss crucial contextual learning.
4. College Education: Traditional higher education often fails to fully prepare graduates for specific job requirements, necessitating additional on-the-job training.

## The Next LX Approach: A Flight Simulator for Office Work
Our simulator replicates a modern office environment, complete with the tools and interactions found in today's workplaces, including those with remote employees.

Here's how our learning process works:

1. Project Assignment: Learners are given a real-world project to complete.
2. Mentor Coaching: Discussions with AI-powered mentors and managers provide guidance and context for the task.
3. Project Execution: Learners perform the assigned tasks using real tools in a simulated environment.
4. Assessment and Feedback: Comprehensive evaluation of the work, with actionable feedback for improvement.
5. Mastery and Progression: This cycle repeats with increasing complexity until skills are mastered.

## The AI Advantage
What makes our approach uniquely powerful is the integration of AI throughout the system. AI generates the learning sequence, creates projects, assesses work, and even populates the simulated workplace with realistic "coworkers," managers, and mentors. This AI-driven approach allows us to create highly realistic, responsive, and scalable training environments for a wide range of office-based professions, from product management and software development to digital marketing and customer success.

## Sim-based training + AI = training transformation
Simulation-based training represents a paradigm shift in job preparation and skill acquisition. By leveraging AI and creating immersive, realistic work environments, we can offer more effective, efficient, and scalable training solutions. This approach not only revolutionizes job training but also has the potential to transform hiring practices, opening up new possibilities in the world of work and education.
